# Guiding-DIP-Early-Stopping-with-DDPM-inspired-Supervision
## Introduction
In this work, we propose a approach to guide early stopping in Deep Image Prior (DIP) training by incorporating supervision inspired by Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). By introducing progressive denoising stages, we aim to enhance the hierarchical representation learning in DIP. Our method leverages metrics such as PSNR and SSIM to determine the optimal stopping point, ensuring improved reconstruction quality.
